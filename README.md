# DATASET ON THE APPOINTMENT NO-SHOW RATE AT 5 CLINICS IN DES MOINES METRO AREA, IOWA, USA 

In this project, we used a dataset from a healthcare company, which contains the data of appointments scheduled in the Des Moines Metro area for 5 different clinics in 2018. The dataset was provided to the School of Business of Missouri State University in April 2019 for use of MBA students in doing a business case study. The dataset has the label as the status of the appointment, which is either show or no-show.

Our goal is to predict the likelihood of a given appointment whether the person will be present on the allocated appointment schedule or not. To predict this, we tried different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees,  Linear regression, and clustering. Before implementing these algorithms, we did extensive data preprocessing including data cleaning, data encoding, balancing datasets, normalizing, etc. Our dataset was imbalanced. As the size of the dataset is small, we did oversample by using imblern oversampling SMOTE. After preprocessing the dataset, we implemented different algorithms and tuned parameter iteratively to get a list of performance. After implementing algorithms, we analyze the result and show which information is important to check to know the maximum likelihood of a patient whether she/he will be present at the scheduled time or not.
